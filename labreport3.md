# Lab Report #3
I chose to do the copying whole directories, and it was more difficult due to being in windows becuase some of the instructions didnt work.

I copied the whole folder over with the * command instead of the . when I used the . it would start copying over hidden files as well. Everything was done in VS Code.

afterwards, I just ran the code using the junit tests and by cd into the correct file in the remote computer.

 After this, I ran all the commands in one line, using " " for the commands after in the remote computer, and moving the repository over in the local computer, all in one line.It was honestly really difficult to find the correct way to do this, and it gave a ton of errors until I found the one that worked.
